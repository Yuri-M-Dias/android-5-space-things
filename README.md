# android-5-space-things
Android app for Udacity and Goi√¢nia's GDG. It's aim is to provide some interesting space and astronomy facts for the reader, in a simple and controlled way. The original idea was to provide these from the web, but i didn't had enough time to do it nicely. The nice thing about this app is that it's quite easy to add a new fact: everything is being done dynamically, so you can add a new fact by just adding an image, the text for it on the strings, and adding one line of code.

## Running
There should be nothing different that needs to be done for running this app under Android Studio. You can just import from VCS using the file menu, connect your phone/emulator and run it. There's some gradle dependendies that should be downloaded automatically for you. 

## Enviroment
That's all that i had to do to run it. I'm also using API 23, though my phone is 5.0 and i can test it currently without problems. This app is untested on newer/older android versions other than these.
